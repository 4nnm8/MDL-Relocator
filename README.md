# MDL-Relocator

For Source 1 Engine models: modifies $modelname in .QC file to the current path of your MDL file.

### Use

Launch "MDLRelocator.ps1" from PowerShell (tested from version 5.1).

### Contribute

This is the first time I've programmed something that isn't web-based so help is very welcome for improvments (particularly in terms of performance when it comes to processing large numbers of files) and make it a cross-plateform executable.
