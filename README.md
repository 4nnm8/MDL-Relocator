### Use

Launch "MDLRelocator.ps1" from PowerShell (tested from version 5.1).

Select a folder which contains .MDL files or drag'n drop .MDL files on the list. The rest is autocompleted.

Your files need to be in the /models folder or one of its subfolder.

### Contribute

This is the first time I've programmed something that isn't web-based so help is very welcome for improvments (particularly in terms of performance when it comes to processing large numbers of files) and make it a cross-plateform executable.
